 Today marked the conclusion of basic GPS code and Tree Farm code. As a recap of what I have done,
 

 - Tree Farm changed to use oak wood with ceiling
 
 - Tree Farm code changed to be more modular, handle oak leaves, and only leave 8 coal in each furnace.
 
 - Created a pastebin for auto-installing GitRepo 

At this point the tree farm seems to be self sustaining, though it is definitely slow. I'm curious if a cause for this is the function
```lua
turtle.suck()
```
which is being run every time the turtle moves forward (except perhaps when near a sapling, which I may want to fix). Fixing this is not necessarily trivial to implement, though I think carefully placed water source blocks should do it. The trick will be getting the turtles to transport the water correctly via buckets, since we will be restricted to survival.

As far as the auto-installing GitRepo goes, what I did was quite simple. All that is required is to load a floppy into a disk drive, access it via a computer using ```cd``` command, and run
```lua
pastebin get waeewzEV startup
```
In theory, this should be doable without ```cd``` using
```lua
pastebin get waeewzEV disk/startup
```
which I will test tomorrow. The current installer code is merely a very minor edit to Eric Wieser's CC-GitHub code set to auto install our libraries. It reads as such:
```lua
local tree = select(1,...)
if not tree then
	tree = 'master'
end
local url = ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github/%s'):format(tree)
local response = http.get(url..'/install.lua').readAll()
loadstring(response)()
shell.run("github","clone","Naverb/SkyNet","SkyNet")
```
Soon I wish to have this script automatically load any scripts ending in _api using the ```os.loadAPI()``` function in CC.

As far as MC goes, Anthony was successful in getting the pathfinding AI working today. The code is still early in development, but seems powerful enough to support decentralized clusters of turtles eventually, perhaps via ender modems to connect the clusters.

As far as personal life goes, today I emailed my research professor Dr. Cardon to set up a meeting, and to postulate the following:

 - Can one extend Jensen's Disk Theorem to any classes of entire (or perhaps meromorphic) functions? Perhaps in the sense that if $f$ is (at least locally) a limit (uniform limit on compact sets perhaps?) of polynomials belonging to some "nice enough" class, then (at least one of, if not all of) the zeros of $f'$ must lie within the limit of the Jensen Disks of the polynomials?

Given the prominence of Jensen's Disk Theorem I would guess there is some trivial counter example I should be thinking of that would prevent any theorem of this sort, but (perhaps embarrassingly) nothing comes to mind.

Other than working on SkyNet, other things on the agenda for tomorrow include:

 - Calling Rec Center to set up Ping Pong
 - Contacting New Century Scholarship
 - Signing up for classes in Fall Semester
