Today I will be working on the first major task in the MWP (Minimal Working Prototype), namely basic scripts to connect ComputerCraft to GitHub and setting up Lua repo in GitHub. I will also be finding generally useful information.

### Connecting ComputerCraft to GitHub
It appears that CC only natively supports Pastebin as a source of scripts, which creates an issue with syncing to GitHub. A couple ideas occur to me:

 1.  We can try to jury rig this with pre-built scripts, as found [here](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/4072-github-repository-downloader/). 
 
 2. We can use a resource pack to load in scripts and have the pack auto-update with GitHub.
 
 3. We can jury rig GitHub to sync into an organized Pastebin directory
 
```lua
    function factorial(n)
	  local x = 1
	  for i = 2, n do
    x = x * i
	  end
	  return x
	end
```
