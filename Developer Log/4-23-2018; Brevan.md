Today I will be working on the first major task in the MWP (Minimal Working Prototype), namely basic scripts to connect ComputerCraft to GitHub and setting up Lua repo in GitHub.

**Connecting ComputerCraft to GitHub**

```lua
    function factorial(n)
	  local x = 1
	  for i = 2, n do
    x = x * i
	  end
	  return x
	end
```
