Today I will be working on the first major task in the MWP (Minimal Working Prototype), namely basic scripts to connect ComputerCraft to GitHub and setting up Lua repo in GitHub. I will also be finding generally useful information.

## Connecting ComputerCraft to GitHub

It appears that CC only natively supports Pastebin as a source of scripts, which creates an issue with syncing to GitHub. A few ideas have occured to me:

 1.  We can try to jury rig this with pre-built scripts, as found [here](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/4072-github-repository-downloader/). 
 
 2. We can use a resource pack to load in scripts and have the pack auto-update with GitHub.
 
 3. We can jury rig GitHub to sync into an organized Pastebin directory

## Connecting via Script
To download the GitHub commands onto our computer, we first run the command
```
pastebin get wPtGKMam GitHub
```
Next, we must load the GitHub program as a separate API.
```lua
os.loadAPI("myApiFile")
```
We now have access to the following commands:
```lua
function main( path )
function printTitle()
function printUsage()
function writeCenter( str )
function downloadFile( path, url, name )
function getGithubContents( path )
function isBlackListed( path )
function downloadManager( path )
function parseInput( user, repo , dldir, path, branch )
```
## Testing the Connection
 
 In order to test that the GitHub downloaded succeeded, we will have our turtle run the following script:
```lua
for i =  1,  6
	do turtle.forward() 
end
```
