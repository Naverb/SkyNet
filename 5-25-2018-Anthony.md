After spending a while trying to figure out how lua coroutines work, we realized that they're complicated. In fact, ComputerCraft's `parallel` API is complicated, so I dug into the source code for ComputerCraft to understand how the parallel API interacts with computers, coroutines, and the `OS` API. Here are the questions to explore:

- How does `parallel.waitForAny(...)` use coroutines to run multiple tasks somewhat simultaneously?

- How does `os.pullEvent(...)` instruct the computer to yield the task so that the computer can switch between tasks?

- How does `os.queueEvent(...)` queue events in the computer?

- What even are events?!!!!1!!!11?

### The Parallel API

We first look at `waitForAny` in the ComputerCraft source code in `resources/assets/computercraft/lua/rom/apis/parallel.lua`:

```lua
function waitForAny( ... )
    local routines = create( ... )
    return runUntilLimit( routines, #routines - 1 )
end
```

Here, `routines` creates an array of lua coroutines from functions passed as arguments to `waitForAny`. These routines are then passed to `runUntilLimit` where the coroutines are resumed in a loop, removing coroutines from the `routines` as their statuses become dead:

```lua
local ok, param = coroutine.resume( r, table.unpack( eventData, 1, eventData.n ) )
```
```eventData``` is merely a variable to pass arguments between coroutines (recall that `coroutine.yield` returns values - it is analogous to `return` for ordinary functions, and `coroutine.resume` can receive arguments that are passed to the coroutine).

From here we realize that the parallel API is deeply integrated with coroutines. This leads to two important conclusions:

- The functions passed to `waitForAny` must call `coroutine.yield` somehow, otherwise `waitForAny` will not work.

- Like lua coroutines, the parallel API does not provide true multitasking. Rather, it provides a convenient way to alternate between coroutines.

In the ComputerCraft Wiki, example uses of `waitForAny` do not explicitly mention `coroutine.yield(...)`, such as:

```lua
local function receive ()
 print(rednet.receive())
end

local function send ()
 rednet.broadcast(read())
end

parallel.waitForAny(receive, send)
```
In this case, `rednet.*` uses the `OS` API to manage coroutines, including `coroutine.yield`.

### The OS API

The OS API is essentially a wrapper for coroutines. ComputerCraft appears to use the OS API to create a sort of task manager: the OS is a thread that should never terminate, and processes are queued and run via scheduling a `coroutine.resume`. 

Digging into `resources/assets/computercraft/lua/bios.lua`, we see part of the coroutine foundation of the OS API:

```lua
function os.pullEventRaw( sFilter )
    return coroutine.yield( sFilter )
end

function os.pullEvent( sFilter )
    local eventData = table.pack( os.pullEventRaw( sFilter ) )
    if eventData[1] == "terminate" then
        error( "Terminated", 0 )
    end
    return table.unpack( eventData, 1, eventData.n )
end
```

Here we see that `os.pullEvent` is just a wrapper for `coroutine.yield`. This provides the interface for functions like `rednet.*` to interact with the parallel API. This also suggests that we can structure our SkyNet code to interact with the parallel API via `pullEvent`. Perhaps we can create an event-based system for each turtle, queueing and executing tasks procedurally as the turtle communicates with SkyNet.

This begs the question, how do we queue tasks using the OS API? The answer is not found in the lua code (as far as I know), but digging into the Java source code, we see functions that serve the foundation for the OS API and events:

In `java/dan200/computercraft/core/computer/Computer.java`:

```java
public void queueEvent( final String event, final Object[] arguments )
    {
        synchronized( this )
        {
            if( m_state != State.Running )
            {
                return;
            }
        }
        
        final Computer computer = this;
        ITask task = new ITask() {
            @Override
            public Computer getOwner()
            {
                return computer;
            }

            @Override
            public void execute()
            {
                synchronized( this )
                {
                    if( m_state != State.Running )
                    {
                        return;
                    }
                }
                
                synchronized( m_machine )
                {
                    m_machine.handleEvent( event, arguments );
                    if( m_machine.isFinished() )
                    {
                        m_terminal.reset();
                        m_terminal.write( "Error resuming bios.lua" );
                        m_terminal.setCursorPos( 0, 1 );
                        m_terminal.write( "ComputerCraft may be installed incorrectly" );

                        stopComputer( false );
                    }
                }
            }
        };
        
        ComputerThread.queueTask( task, computer );
    }
```

Which mentions `handleEvent`, defined in `java/dan200/computercraft/core/lua/LuaJLuaMachine.java`:

```java
public void handleEvent( String eventName, Object[] arguments )
    {
        if( m_mainRoutine == null )
        {
            return;
        }

        if( m_eventFilter != null && eventName != null && !eventName.equals( m_eventFilter ) && !eventName.equals( "terminate" ) )
        {
            return;
        }
        
        try
        {            
            LuaValue[] resumeArgs;
            if( eventName != null )
            {
                resumeArgs = toValues( arguments, 2 );
                resumeArgs[0] = m_mainRoutine;
                resumeArgs[1] = toValue( eventName );
            }
            else
            {
                resumeArgs = new LuaValue[1];
                resumeArgs[0] = m_mainRoutine;
            }
            
            Varargs results = m_coroutine_resume.invoke( LuaValue.varargsOf( resumeArgs ) );
            if( m_hardAbortMessage != null ) 
            {
                throw new LuaError( m_hardAbortMessage );
            }
            else if( results.arg1().checkboolean() == false )
            {
                throw new LuaError( results.arg(2).checkstring().toString() );
            }
            else
            {
                LuaValue filter = results.arg(2);
                if( filter.isstring() )
                {
                    m_eventFilter = filter.toString();
                }
                else
                {
                    m_eventFilter = null;
                }
            }
                        
            LuaThread mainThread = (LuaThread)m_mainRoutine;
            if( mainThread.getStatus().equals("dead") )
            {
                m_mainRoutine = null;
            }
        }
        catch( LuaError e )
        {
            ((LuaThread)m_mainRoutine).abandon();
            m_mainRoutine = null;
        }
        finally
        {
            m_softAbortMessage = null;
            m_hardAbortMessage = null;
        }
    }
```

Sifting through the Java, we see that `queueEvent` ultimately calls `m_coroutine_resume.invoke(...)`, which is likely the `coroutine.resume` from lua. Naturally, `queueEvent` and `pullEvent` are complementary functions that wrap `coroutine.resume` and `coroutine.yield` respectively.

Hence, the event functions in the OS API suggest that ComputerCraft uses a central task manager to handle processes in CraftOS, particularly any event, from key presses to rednet events. 

We note that `coroutine.yield` returns the parameters passed to `coroutine.resume` when a coroutine is resumed. Hence, `handleEvent` reveals how `os.pullEvent` tracks events in CraftOS. We note that `resumeArgs` is passed to `m_coroutine.resume.invoke`, so `resumeArgs` carries the event information that `coroutine.yield` returns. Specifically, `resumeArgs[1]` is the name of the event.

Thus, `os.queueEvent` takes an argument that is assigned to `eventName`, passed to `resumeArgs[1]` and then returned by `coroutine.yield`, which is then returned by `os.pullEvent`.

### What does this mean?

The OS API handles coroutines nicely, and since it wraps `coroutine.resume` and `coroutine.yield`, the OS API provides the same functionality as the coroutine API. In fact, the overhead of the OS API does not seem significant, so we may want to consider using CraftOS's event system in lieu of writing our own libraries to handle coroutines. This keeps things simple, providing a system similar to event listeners, where `os.pullEvent` functions like event listeners that block a method until `os.queueEvent` schedules it.
